Draconic Evolution adds powerful new tools, Items, weapons and Armor. The premise is the enigmatic ore - Draconium. As you progress you find it has many uses from the mundane such as machines and items, to the near-mystical at the top with Awakened Draconium to make extremely powerful armor and tools.
